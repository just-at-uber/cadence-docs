A workflow has full control over which activities are executed, and in which order. A workflow must not affect the external world directly, only through activities. What makes workflow code a workflow is that its state is preserved by Cadence. Therefore any failure of a worker process that hosts the workflow code does not affect the workflow execution. The workflow continues as if these failures did not happen. At the same time, activities can fail any moment for any reason. Because workflow code is fully fault-oblivious, it is guaranteed to get notifications about activity failures or timeouts and act accordingly. There is no limit on potential workflow duration." class="term">workflow</a>.</p> <h2 id="install-cadence-service-locally"><a href="#install-cadence-service-locally" class="header-anchor">#</a> Install Cadence Service Locally</h2> <h3 id="install-docker"><a href="#install-docker" class="header-anchor">#</a> Install docker</h3> <p>Follow the Docker installation instructions found here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <h3 id="run-cadence-server-using-docker-compose"><a href="#run-cadence-server-using-docker-compose" class="header-anchor">#</a> Run Cadence Server Using Docker Compose</h3> <p>Download the Cadence docker-compose file:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">curl</span> -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber/cadence/master/docker/docker-compose.yml
